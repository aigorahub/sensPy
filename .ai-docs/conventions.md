## Where to Find Conventions

### Naming Patterns
- Check existing files for naming conventions
- Check types definitions for interface organization patterns

### Code Standards
- **Schema Patterns**: Check for schema validation patterns (e.g. Zod)
- **Error Handling**: Review how errors are caught and reported
- **Async Patterns**: Observe how async/await and promises are handled

### UI/UX Patterns
- **State Management**: Review state hooks and context usage
- **Components**: Check shared UI components for reusable patterns

### Integration Patterns
- **API Patterns**: Review API route handlers for request/response structures
- **Data Fetching**: Review how external data is fetched and cached
